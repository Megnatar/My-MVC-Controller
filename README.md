# My-MVC-Controller

**End project for BitAcademy:**

my_mvc controller written by Joz Severijnse.

For me this project was all about learning how frameworks stick together.
I did so through writing this code and learning from what is available on the internet.
It is wel documented inside....


**Installation**:

First you need to install php MyAdmin and MySql to be able to mange the Database.

phpMyAdmin:
https://www.phpmyadmin.net

MySQL:

Once installed you need to import the SQL database file:
my_mvc.sql

Since this application depends on the folder structure.
Please copy/paste the mvc folder to the root folder of your web server.
Before opening the url below. Make sure you add my_mvc.sql to you're server.


The url is: http://localhost/mvc
