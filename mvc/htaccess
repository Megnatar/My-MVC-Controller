# On my linux machine I needed to enable 'rewrite' in file /etc/atache2/apache2.conf
# Set 'AllowOverride None' to 'AllowOverride All'.
# I also needed to enable the module by running command:    sudo a2enmod rewrite
# Restart the server by running:                            sudo systemctl restart apache2
#
# Enable rewrite module so apatche redirects the browser to the prefix folder.
# The prefix is defined by the RewriteRule. The prefix folder here is public/ .
# Option L means: Stop the rewriting process immediately and don't apply any more rules.
# The rule discribes that basically any file and folder is allowed to be rewritten in only public/ .
# So this also means that the app folder, which is not described in de config, is private!
