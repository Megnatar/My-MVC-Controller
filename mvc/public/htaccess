# On my linux machine I needed to enable 'rewrite' in file /etc/atache2/apache2.conf
# Set 'AllowOverride None' to 'AllowOverride All'.
# I also needed to enable the module by running command:    sudo a2enmod rewrite
# Restart the server by running:                            sudo systemctl restart apache2
#
# Enable rewrite module and don't allow multiple folder views.
# Browser base folder: /mvc/. Let the browser know url is http://localhost/mvc/
# The .htaccess in mvc tells browser to use this public/ . For this rewrite folder.
# The conditions are  to allow for files and folders to be rewritten to this base folder /mvc/.* .
# The rule is for the index or any file|folder to load with parametrs, when needed.
